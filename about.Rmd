## About


My name is Jake Ford, I live in Durham, North Carolina. I'm a Data Scientist for [Solstice](https://solstice.us/), working to democratize access to solar energy. Previously, I've worked in policy analysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government level.

I like to think and write about policy related questions in a data science framework. Sometimes it's fun, sometime's it's serious, hopefully more often than not it's both! 


Here's charlie, our rescue greyhound. You'll probably be seeing him a lot here. Look at that snoot.
