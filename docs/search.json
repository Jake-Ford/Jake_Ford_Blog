Previously, I’ve worked in policy\nanalysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government\nlevel.\n\nMy interests include travel, food, their very important combination.\nHere on this blog, I like to think and write about policy related\nquestions in a data science framework; along with books I’m reading,\npodcasts I’m listening to, NIMBY attempts to Jim Crow-ify their gains in\ncapital investments. Sometimes it’s fun, sometime’s it’s serious,\nhopefully more often than not it’s both!\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a\nlot here. Look at that snoot.\n\n\n\n\n",
