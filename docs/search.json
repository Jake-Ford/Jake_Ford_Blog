Previously, I’ve worked in policy\nanalysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government\nlevel.\n\nMy interests include travel, food, their very important combination\nin addition to writing about policy related questions in a data science\nframework; along with books I’m reading, podcasts I’m listening to,\nNIMBY attempts to Jim Crow-ify their gains in capital investments.\nSometimes it’s fun, sometime’s it’s serious, hopefully more often than\nnot it’s both!\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a\nlot here. Look at that snoot.\n\n\n\n\n",
